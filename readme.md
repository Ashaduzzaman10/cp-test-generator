##
step 1 --> go to brute force solution file 
step 2 --> go to random test generator file and here i will generate some random test case for my problem (here one thing i must have in mind given problem statement here is a input condition based on the  question i will generate test case for this condition  )
step --> 3 go to my_solution.cpp file and my initial solution of this particular problem i will write here 
step 0 --> then i go to input.text file and input here my problem sample test case which is given by the problem in  online platform
